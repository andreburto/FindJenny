Please don't judge me on this code. It's a proof of concept prototype consisting of my first, functional hardware controlling software.

The **hardware** folder has all the Arduino bits: the C++ sketch and the Fritzing circuit diagram.

The **game** folder has the code and art for the C# game that the controller manipulates.
